 <p>The machiavel is one of the most beautiful literary archetypes, deeply complex and volatile. Like flowers there exists endless variety—from machiavels that are behemoths of complexity, with intricate motives and actions that demand you to pay attention to them to flat plain characters that dull your eyes and mind in reading them. This variety is a testament to the machiavel's versatility with the only limit to their depth being the writer’s skill. And to think that this archetype would be naught if one letter had reached its intended recipient.</p>

 <p>1513 Niccolo Machiavelli wrote the treatise <i>‘The Prince’</i>. Machiavelli was a disgraced Florentine diplomat vying for the favour of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the prince of Florence at the time. Machiavelli wrote The Prince as a treatise, to serve as a guide to Lorenzo on how to be a good ruler but the ‘good’ ruler Machiavelli envisioned would enshroud his name in infamy forever. </p>

 <p>The ruler Machiavelli envisioned was self-serving, quick to make and break promises, and had no regard for the harm his actions caused believing no method is amoral, as long as the results are to your benefit. The three elements that make a character machiavellian were derived from these traits: <strong>duplicity</strong>, <strong>self-interest</strong> and the belief that the <strong>ends justify the means</strong>.</p>

    Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed<br>
    And my invention thrive, <br>
   Edmund, the base shall top th’ legitimate.<br>
   I grow, I prosper.<br>
   Now, gods, stand up for bastards!”
</div>

<p>
This quote is by Edmund, the main antagonist in Shakespeare’s King Lear; a play written in 1605-06. In this quote, Edmund is confessing his self-interest to the audience, he does not have any grand goal of selflessness, he is not trying to avenge bastards as a whole, no! Shakespeare makes it clear that Edmund has no greater selfless motivation, he is purely self-serving. Shakespeare leaves no room for any other interpretation.
</p>

<p>
This is a clear deviation from the prince, where Machiavelli attempts to hide his self-serving way by making the prince a ‘hero’ for Italy, with his actions necessary to defend Italy from foreign threats. Machiavelli did this to seem selfless to Lorenzo de’ Medici, as to gain his trust; although that backfired on him, as his name became synonymous with lechery itself. Although Machiavelli hid his self-interest; Machiavelli frequently praised self-serving rulers such as   Agathoclest the Sicilian. Machiavelli writes about him “Having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others” (The Prince, chapter 8)
</p>

<p>
The reason that the element of self-interest is so much more clearer in King Lear, is the difference in the medium and time period between King Lear and The Prince. King Lear tells a linear story of a kingdom’s decline due to treachery, gullibility and incompetence. The Prince however tells a broad narrative of good leadership through many small fictional and real-life stories of failed and successful leadership. To clarify this, you need to understand the difference between a story and a narrative.
</p>

<p>
 A story can be thought of as simply a set of events, with a beginning and end, so for King Lear, we can describe its story easily: King Lear decides to divvy his kingdom, he exiles his youngest daughter, Edmund starts scheming and steals his father’s land, and then he gets defeated by his brother Edgar who becomes the new king. Now a narrative can be thought of as the broad ideas and themes of a story, so in the case of King Lear, it is a narrative of treachery and honesty.
