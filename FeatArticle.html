 <p>The Machiavel is one of the most beautiful literary archetypes, deeply complex and volatile. Like flowers, there exists an endless variety—from Machiavels that are behemoths of complexity, with intricate motives and actions that demand you to pay attention to them, to flat plain characters that dull your eyes and mind in reading them. In this article, I will explain and contextualise the creation and development of the Machiavel, from Machiavelli himself to Shakespeare.</p>

 <p>In 1513 Niccolo Machiavelli wrote the treatise ‘The Prince’. Machiavelli was a disgraced Florentine diplomat vying for the favour of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the prince of Florence at the time. Machiavelli wrote The Prince as a treatise, to serve as a guide to Lorenzo on good leadership, but the ‘good’ ruler Machiavelli envisioned would mire his name in infamy forever; as The Prince would not reach Lorenzo alone; no, it would spread throughout medieval Europe and the literary world as a whole.</p>

 <p>The ruler Machiavelli envisioned was self-serving, quick to make and break promises, and had no regard for the harm his actions caused believing no methods are amoral, as long as the results are to your benefit. With this, the Machiavellian narrative was formed, a narrative of duplicity, self-interest and amorality. From this narrative, the three elements that make a character Machiavellian were derived:</p>

   I grow, I prosper.<br>
   Now, gods, stand up for bastards!”<br>
   (Act 1, Scene 2, King Lear)
</div>

<p>
 This is a soliloquy delivered by Edmund, the main antagonist in Shakespeare’s King Lear; a play written in 1605-06. By performing a soliloquy, Edmund is confessing his self-interest to the audience. With this, Shakespeare makes it clear that Edmund has no greater selfless motivation, he is not trying to avenge bastards as a whole, no! He is purely self-interested. Shakespeare leaves no room for any other interpretation.
</p>

<p>
 This is a clear deviation from The Prince, where Machiavelli attempts to ‘sweeten’ and mask the prince's self-interest, by making the prince a ‘hero’ for Italy, with his selfish actions necessary to defend Italy from foreign threats. Unlike Edmund's soliloquy, this leaves room for positive views of Machiavelli's character. Although he attempted to sweeten the prince's self-interest, Machiavelli himself frequently praised self-serving rulers such as Agathoclest the Sicilian. Machiavelli writes about him: “Having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others” (The Prince, chapter 8)
</p>

<p>
 The reason why the element of self-interest is so much more pronounced in King Lear than in The Prince is due to the different mediums Machiavelli and Shakespeare utilised. Shakespeare wrote a play, a cohesive story with a clear beginning and end. Machiavelli however wrote a treatise telling a broad narrative on good and bad leadership illustrated through many small historical and fictional examples. To fully grasp this explanation, you must first understand the difference between narrative and story.

<p> 
A story can be thought of as simply a set of events, with a beginning and end; so for King Lear, we can describe its story easily: King Lear decides to divvy his kingdom amongst his daughters, he exiles his youngest daughter, Edmund schemes and steals his brother’s inheritance, and then he gets defeated by his brother Edgar who becomes the new king. Now a narrative can be thought of as the broader ideas and themes of a story; in the case of King Lear, it is a narrative of treachery and honesty.

<p style= " font-size: 1.8em; padding-left: 3em; padding-right: 9em;"> 
<strong> “It is necessary for a prince who is to hold &nbsp; his own to know how to do wrong”</strong> - Niccolo Machiavelli
</p>
 <p>This quote I feel, really encompasses Machiavelli’s views on his prince, Machiavelli is not some villainous monster telling Lorenzo to do evil actions just for the sake of them. No, Machiavelli genuinely believes that if Lorenzo acted like the prince he made; the Italian peninsula would rise from its divided state and be able to defend itself, now whether this is correct or not, is pure speculation. And that's where the main difference between the element of duplicity lies between Shakespeare and Machiavelli: the view of their audiences.</p>

 <p>Shakespeare wrote King Lear to a Christian audience who believed that duplicity was a great sin, one of the attributes of the snake, something against society itself. So when Edmund declares “Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law my services are bound.”(Act 1, Scene 2, King Lear) in a soliloquy; Shakespeare creates a dichotomy between Edmund and order, making him a chaotic evil in the vain of the devil, treacherous and sly, whose promises you cannot trust. 
</p>

 <p>Machiavelli however wrote The Prince to an audience he believed, would appreciate the duplicity of his character as a necessary trait, it’s why he used persuasive language, to convince Lorenzo to act duplicitous to succeed. Lorenzo may have taken his advice too well though, as he did not release Machiavelli, a self-declared benefactor of his from exile.

        The end justifies the means
    </h2>
  

  <p>Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law / My services are bound”(Act 1, Scene 2, King Lear), This a soliloquy performed by Edmund, and I believe this best represents the difference between how Shakespeare and Machiavelli view the belief that the end justifies the means.
    Shakespeare gives Edmund a sense of apathy to his actions, he doesn’t reflect on them, and he doesn’t reflect on the harm they cause, he simply does them; making him seem like a force of nature, acting without compassion. </p>
<p>“ In the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.”- Niccolo Machiavelli. Machiavelli, however, takes a much more active approach, he is telling Lorenzo if he doesn’t do this, he will fail, he is using consequentialism to bend Lorenzo’s hand.</p>

Conclusion
    </h2>
<p>The narrative of machiavel is one I believe continues to shape the world, now what is a narrative that shapes the world? Well, I consider a narrative that shapes our world, to be a narrative that has and continues to change the way we view the world and the way literature is written. The narrative of Machiavel encompasses this perfectly; it has changed the way we look at people in power, we look at them with more scepticism due to the Machiavel. It’s also changed the way villains are written, villains are no longer one-note characters to serve as moral enemies for the masses, now they are fully-fledged characters, with their motivations.</p>
