        <p>The Machiavel is one of the most beautiful literary archetypes, deeply complex and volatile. Like flowers,
            there exists an endless variety—from Machiavels that are behemoths of complexity, with intricate motives and
            actions that demand you to pay attention to them, to flat bare characters that dull your eyes and mind in
            reading them. In this article, I will explain and contextualise the creation and development of the
            Machiavel, from Machiavelli to Shakespeare.</p>

        <p>In 1513 Niccolo Machiavelli wrote ‘<i>The Prince</i>’. Machiavelli was a disgraced Florentine diplomat vying
            for the favour of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the prince of Florence at the time. Machiavelli wrote <i>The
                Prince</i> as a treatise, to serve as a guide on good leadership, but the ‘good’ ruler Machiavelli
            envisioned would mire his name in infamy forever. <i>The Prince</i> would not reach Lorenzo alone, no, it
            would spread across medieval Europe and the literary world as a whole.</p>

        <p>The ruler Machiavelli envisioned was self-serving, quick to make and break promises, he had no regard for the
            harm his actions caused believing no methods are amoral, as long as the results are to your benefit. With
            this, the Machiavellian narrative was formed, a narrative of duplicity, self-interest and amorality. From
            this narrative, the three elements that make a character Machiavellian were derived:</p>

                    Now, gods, stand up for bastards!” (Act 1, Scene 2, King Lear)<br>

            </div>

            <p>
                This is a soliloquy delivered by Edmund, the main antagonist in Shakespeare’s <i> King Lear</i>; a play
                written between 1605 and 1606. By using a soliloquy, Shakespeare is conveying to the audience, that
                Edmund has no greater selfless motivation, he is not trying to avenge bastards as a whole. No, he is
                purely self-serving. Shakespeare leaves no room for any other interpretation.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                This is a clear deviation from <i>The Prince</i>, where Machiavelli attempts to ‘sweeten’ and mask the
                prince's self-interest using an appeal to urgency, by reminding Lorenzo again and again, that Italy is
                under threat, with his selfish actions necessary to defend Italy from them. Unlike Edmund's soliloquy,
                this leaves room for positive views of Machiavelli's character. Although he attempted to sweeten the
                prince's self-interest, Machiavelli himself frequently praised self-serving rulers such as Agathoclest
                the Sicilian. Machiavelli writes about him: <span class="quote"
                    sound="sounds/MachiavellArticle/\MachiavelliQuoteOne.mp3">“Having deliberately resolved to make
                    himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others” (The Prince, chapter
                    8)</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason why the element of self-interest is so much more pronounced in <i> King Lear</i> than in The
                Prince is due to the different mediums Machiavelli and Shakespeare utilised. Shakespeare wrote a play, a
                cohesive story with a clear beginning and end, so all character motivations needed to be clear.
                Machiavelli however wrote a treatise telling a broad narrative on good and bad leadership illustrated
                throughout many small historical and fictional examples. To fully grasp this explanation, you must first
                understand the difference between narrative and story.

            <p>
                A story can be thought of as a set of events, with a beginning and end; so for <i> King Lear</i>, we can
                describe its story easily: King Lear decides to divvy his kingdom amongst his daughters, he exiles his
                youngest daughter, Edmund schemes and steals his brother’s inheritance, and then he gets defeated by his
                brother Edgar who becomes the new king. Now a narrative can be thought of as the broader ideas and
                themes of a story; in the case of <i> King Lear</i>, it is a narrative of treachery and honesty.

                <strong class="quote" sound="sounds/MachiavellArticle//PrinceSecondQuote.mp3"> “It is necessary for a
                    prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to
                    necessity”</strong><i>(The Prince, chapter 15)</i>
            </p>
            <p>This quote I feel, really encompasses Machiavelli’s views on his prince. Machiavelli is not some
                villainous monster telling Lorenzo to do evil actions just for the sake of them. No, Machiavelli
                genuinely believes that if Lorenzo acted like the prince he made, the Italian peninsula would rise from
                its divided state and be able to defend itself. Whether that was a correct assessment, is pure
                speculation. And that's where the main difference between the element of duplicity lies between
                Shakespeare and Machiavelli: the view of their audiences.</p>

            <p>

            <p>Shakespeare wrote <i> King Lear</i> to a Christian audience who believed that duplicity was a great sin,
                one of the attributes of the Serpent, something against society itself. So when Edmund tells the
                audience, <span class="quote" sound="sounds/MachiavellArticle/Edmundsolilquyact1scene2part1.mp3"> “Thou,
                    nature, art my goddess; to thy law my services are bound.”</span>(Act 1, Scene 2, King Lear)
                Shakespeare creates a dichotomy between Edmund and order, making him a chaotic evil in the vein of the
                Devil, treacherous and sly, holding no loyalty. </p>

            <p>Machiavelli however wrote <i>The Prince</i> to an audience he believed, would <i>appreciate</i> the
                duplicity of his character. It’s why he used persuasive language, as to convince Lorenzo to act
                duplicitous to succeed. Lorenzo may have taken his advice too well though, as he did not release
                Machiavelli, a self-professed benefactor from exile.

            </p>
            <p>

                Once more I’m revisiting this soliloquy by Edmund because I believe this best shows the difference
                between how Shakespeare and Machiavelli view the Machiavel.
                Shakespeare sees The Machiavel as a purely evil character, so he uses detached language to give Edmund a
                sense of apathy to his actions, he doesn’t reflect on them or try to justify the harm they cause, he
                simply does them, like a force of nature, acting without compassion. </p>

                </span><i>(The Prince, chapter 18)</i>. Through this quote,we see Machiavelli taking a much more active
                approach, he is telling Lorenzo if he doesn’t do this, he will fail, he is using consequentialism to
                bend Lorenzo’s hand to his favour.</p>

                Conclusion
            </h2>

            <p>The narrative of the Machiavel continues to shape the world, now what do I mean by shaping the world?
                Well, a narrative that shapes our world is a narrative that has and continues to change the way we view
                the world and the way that literature is written. The narrative of the Machiavel encompasses this
                perfectly. It changed the way we look at people in power, we look at them with more scepticism due to
                the elements of the Machiavel. It’s also changed the way we write villains and view morality as a whole.
                No longer are villains one-note characters to serve as a foil to the main character, now they are
                fully-fledged characters, with complex moral compasses, that make an audience not only sympathise with
                them but empathise.</p>
